# Climate services for health: from global observations to local interventions

This repository contains R scripts used in the analysis of global climate products in temporal models of dengue and malaria transmission in Machala, southern Ecuador.

## Materials and Methods
We formulated temporal models of monthly dengue and malaria cases for Machala, a city located in southern coastal Ecuador, which is a key dengue surveillance site1 and has historically had high rates of malaria transmission2. Monthly clinically suspected cases of dengue between 2002-2014 and monthly cases of Plasmodium vivax malaria between 1990-2015 were modelled using Bayesian hierarchical mixed models developed previously to model malaria and dengue cases in the region3,4. We fitted negative binomial and zero-inflated negative binomial models for monthly dengue and malaria cases, respectively. The log of the mean number of cases of dengue (dt) or malaria (mt) is equal to the log population per 100,000 (Pit) (included as an offset in the model) and log incidence rate log(it) for each time t (12 years for the dengue model and 26 years for the malaria model) (i). The estimated incidence rate for dengue and malaria then includes explanatory climate variables, xit (mean temperature x1t and precipitation x2t), a monthly random effect, (t) introduced using a first order autoregressive model to account for seasonal variation in dengue and malaria, and exchangeable non-structured random effects for each year, (t) to account for interannual changes in disease risk due to unobserved factors3 (ii).
